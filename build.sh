# build.sh -- one-step build for the Rust binding: libitb3.so + cargo
# build. Prerequisites (Go, rustup / cargo) must be installed
# separately; see README.md "Prerequisites" section.
#
# Every artefact this binding owns is removed before the build, so
# nothing in the tree predates the invocation. eitb is a separate crate
# under eitb/ with its own target directory, and it is built here on
# every invocation rather than only when its binary happens to be
# missing.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh             # default build (full asm stack)
#   ./build.sh --noitbasm  # opt out of ITB's SIMD asm kernels
#
# Environment:
#   ITB_SKIP_CLEAN=1       # keep existing artefacts (fast iteration)
#   ITB_KEEP_DOWNLOADS=1   # keep fetched dependency trees

# ---- artefact wipe ---------------------------------------------------
# The build starts from nothing: every artefact this binding owns is
# removed before anything is rebuilt, so no output can predate this
# invocation. ITB_SKIP_CLEAN=1 skips the wipe for fast iteration.
#
# Fetched dependency trees and registry-resolved lock files need network
# to restore, so ITB_KEEP_DOWNLOADS=1 preserves them. That is the weaker
# guarantee: a stale dependency can still mask breakage, and only the
# artefacts this binding compiles itself are then known to be fresh.
#
# Deletion safety: clean_target takes a path relative to this binding's
# own directory. An empty path, an absolute path, or one containing ".."
# is refused outright, and the resolved target is re-checked to lie
# inside the binding directory before removal -- so the wipe cannot
# reach the shared dist/linux-amd64/libitb3.so, the cargo registry
# cache, or anything else outside this directory. Every removal is
# logged first.

# Subtrees, relative to this binding, that a pattern sweep must not
# descend into. A dependency tree preserved by ITB_KEEP_DOWNLOADS sits
# inside this directory, so without this the sweep would reach into the
# very tree the flag is there to protect.
